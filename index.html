          <h2>Complicated Doesn't Mean Good</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          We mock the garishness of the animated GIFs that dominated the early
          web, and yet we see pop-ups for privacy settings as acceptable and
          somehow treat auto-playing videos as if they are anything other than a
          crime against humanity.

          <h2>Adding Friction is Immoral, Actually</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          When someone comes to your house, we all recognize that you shouldn't
          make it hard for them to leave. Cooking dinner for a friend is nice
          and welcoming. Taking an extra long time to cook that meal in order to
          maximize the amount of minutes they spend in your house is not.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people engage in that type of behavior in real life, we call it
          manipulative and predatory. But on the web, it has been rebranded as
          "effective design principles." Putting your boots in the oven doesn't
          make them biscuits. Making an active effort to subvert both the
          interests and autonomy of a visitor is not good web design. Or good
          anything, really.

          <h2>Simplicity Benefits the User</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          People come to a page for the specific content of that page. Nearly
          all additions to the page beyond that make the life of the visitors
          worse because it is explicitly making the purpose of their visit
          harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does a sidebar filled with trending articles make it easier or harder
          to focus on the article the visitor came to the site for? The pop-ups
          pleading for the user's email address whenever their mouse moves away
          from the page are not for the users.

          <h2>Complexity Obscures Self-Interest</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The complexity of websites exists solely to subvert the interests of
          the visitor and exploit them for the benefit of the site owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more complex a page is, the more tools they are employing to
          ensnare the user. It becomes less of a world wide web, and more of a
          spider's web -- with each site trying to maximize the minutes the user
          spends on their site knowing full well that is not in the user's
          interest.

          <h2>A Focus on Purpose</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Not every site needs to be complex and filled with features! If the
          purpose of your page is to communicate something via text,
          interspersing the text with stock photos is annoying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless it's directly related to the article or to facilitate its
          understanding, it's not there to help me with an article I'm already
          enjoying. It's there to keep me visually engaged in an article that I
          might otherwise stop reading.

          <h2>Let's Keep It Simple.</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          This page doesn't use JavaScript! Why? Because there's absolutely no
          need for it! The page is simple and the content is the focus. There
          are a million use cases for JavaScript obviously, but none of them
          apply here. The same is true for many of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is fully accessible for screen readers and loads quickly on any
          device. The simplicity of this stylesheet would bend your bones! This
          <em>should</em> be the goal of most websites. And yet, many pages have
          conflated complexity with quality.
        </p>
        <p>The entirety of this site's CSS:</p>
        <pre><code>body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #eee;
    color: #333;
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 600px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    font-size: 1.15rem;
}</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <header>
          <h2>Let's Surf the Web, Not Get Trapped In It</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The web should be a great tool for communication and sharing! But so
          many of its modern design principles exist to cover up that many of
          these sites are not very good at their core purpose, so they need to
          employ all manner of techniques to obscure that and keep visitors
          locked in to content they might otherwise find unrewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visiting a website should not involve the sacrifice of one's autonomy
          to the latest psychological manipulations. The web used to feel like a
          good and interesting place to be. I think it's because web pages were
          designed to share something, not trap someone.
