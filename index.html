        </header>
        <p>
          We mock the garishness of the animated GIFs that dominated the early
          web, and yet we see pop-ups for privacy settings as acceptable and
          somehow treat auto-playing videos as if they are anything other than a
          crime against humanity.

          <h2>Simplicity Benefits the User</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          People come to a page to read the specific content of that page.
          Nearly all additions to the page beyond that make the life of the
          visitors worse because it is explicitly making the purpose of their
          visit harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does a sidebar filled with trending articles make it easier or harder
          to focus on the article the visitor came to the site for? The pop-ups
          pleading for the user's email address whenever their mouse moves away
          from the page are not for the users.

          <h2>Complexity Obscures Self-Interest</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The complexity of websites exists solely to subvert the interests of
          the visitor and exploit them for the benefit of the site owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more complex a page is, the more tools they are employing to
          ensnare the user. It becomes less of a world wide web, and more of a
          spider's web -- with each site trying to maximize the minutes the user
          spends on their site knowing full well that is not in the user's
          interest.

          <h2>A Focus on Purpose</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Not every site needs to be complex and filled with features! So much
          of what I enjoy on the web is text-based and I find even many of the
          stock photos interspersed to be annoying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless it's directly related to the article, it's not there to help me
          with an article I'm already enjoying. It's there to keep me visually
          engaged in an article that I'm not enjoying and might otherwise stop
          reading.

          <h2>Let's Keep It Simple.</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          This page doesn't use JavaScript! Why? Because there's absolutely no
          need for it! The page is simple and the content is the focus. There
          are a million use cases for JavaScript obviously, but this page
          doesn't need it. A lot of them don't.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is fully accessible for screen readers and loads quickly on any
          device. The simplicity of this stylesheet would bend your bones! This
          <em>should</em> be the goal of most websites. And yet, many pages have
          conflated complexity with quality.
        </p>
        <p>The entirety of this site's CSS:</p>
        <pre><code>body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #eee;
    color: #333;
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 600px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    font-size: 1.15rem;
}</code></pre>
      </section>

          <h2>In Summary</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The web is a great tool for communication and sharing information! But
          so many of its modern design principles exist to cover up that many of
          these sites are not very good at their core purpose, so they need to
          employ all manner of techniques to obscure that and keep visitors
          locked in to content they might otherwise find lacking.
